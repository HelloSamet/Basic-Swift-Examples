/*
 1. Swift Temelleri
 
 If you already know Swift, you can pass this section quickly. But every junior and senior developer needs to grasp the basics very well.
 
 ðŸ“Œ Topics to learn:
 âœ… Swift Syntax (Variables, Constants, Types)
 âœ… Functions and Closures
 âœ… Collections: Array, Set, Dictionary
 âœ… Control Flow (If, Switch, For, While)
 âœ… Options (Optional, Optional Binding, Guard, Nil-Coalescing)
 âœ… Error Management (do-try-catch)
 âœ… Enum and Struct Usage
 âœ… Protocol & Extension Usage
 âœ… Property Wrappers
 
 ðŸ“Œ Application:
 
 Study the use of Optional in detail
 learn how to write code in accordance with SOLID principles with protocol and extension
 Make a small project using Property Wrappers (for example, a module that stores user data using @AppStorage)

// Compound Assignment

myScore *= 2 // Multiples myScore by 2
myScore /= 2 // Divides myScore by 2

// Remainder Operator (%)

let dividend = 10
let divisor = 3
let quotient = dividend / divisor  // quotient has a value of 3
let remainder = dividend % divisor // remainder has a value of 1 ( dividend - (quotient * divisor) )

// Numeric Type Conversion

// â€œSwitch Statement
/*
Youâ€™ve seen if statements and if-else statements that you can use to run certain
 blocks of code depending on certain conditions. But a long chain of if,
 else if, else if ... else statements can become messy and difficult to
 read after a small number of options. Swift has another tool for
 control flow known as a switch statement thatâ€™s optimal for working with
 many potential conditions.
